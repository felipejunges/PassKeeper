# PassKeeper

PassKeeper is a proof-of-concept password manager built with .NET 10 and a GTK-based UI. It is designed to run on both Windows and Linux platforms. The main goal of this project is to explore secure password storage techniques in a cross-platform desktop application.

All data is saved in an encrypted LiteDB database, providing an extra layer of security for stored passwords.

## Project Objective

The objective of PassKeeper is to store users' passwords as securely as possible, using modern encryption and best practices available within the .NET ecosystem. The project demonstrates how to implement password management and encryption in a desktop application.
